# Introduction to Analog-VLSI and Layout

This project encompasses various components of analog and digital VLSI design, including Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), flip-flops, and other digital logic circuits. The repository provides Verilog implementations as well as layout files for these components. This project is part of a pre-graduate exercise for a university course in analog and digital VLSI design. 

## Project Components

### 1. 3-Bit ALU

### 2. D Flip-Flop


### 3. T Flip-Flop


### 4. Waveform Circuit

The Waveform circuit in this repository generates a specific sequence of output values based on input signals.
