3-Bit ALU

This file contains the design and implementation of a simple 3-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing basic arithmetic and logic operations. The ALU supports addition, subtraction, bitwise OR, and bitwise AND operations using opcode representations: 00, 01, 10, and 11 respectively.
